This wrapper tries to make it easy to pull out interesting bits of large
XML files in a space-efficient way.

Almost every XML file I ever look at seems to be large (>1GB) and
oriented around records (MARC records, Solr documents, etc.).  Generally
all I want to do is:

  - read the next record
  - pull out a few of its fields
  - throw the rest away, rinse, repeat

so that's what this does, using XOM and a queue behind the scenes.  Some
example usages:

1.  Parsing Solr responses (which look like this):

  <response>
  <lst name="responseHeader">
   <int name="status">0</int>
   <int name="QTime">0</int>
  </lst>
  <result name="response" numFound="170" start="0">
   <doc>
    <arr name="author"><str>Hardie &amp; Gorman Pty. Ltd</str></arr>
    <arr name="callnumber"><str>MAP FOLDER 176, LFSP 2757</str></arr>
    <arr name="title"><str>Important clearance sale of valuable city, suburban &amp; country properties, at upset prices : including investment, residential and vacant properties, building, farming, agricultural, and grazing lands ... Auction sale, Wednesday, 8th December, 1897 / Hardie &amp; Gorman, Auctioneers</str></arr>
   </doc>
   <doc>
    <arr name="author"><str>Hamburg, Harold G</str></arr>
    <arr name="callnumber"><str>PAM BOX 429</str></arr>
    <arr name="title"><str>The legislation of Richard III</str></arr>
   </doc>
   ...
   </result>
  </response>

to extract a list of authors:

  (with-open [rdr (reader (java.net.URL. "http://my.host/solr/select?q=my+query"))]
    (doall (apply concat
                  (xml-picker-seq
                   rdr
                   "doc"
                   (fn [doc]
                     (let [nodes (.query doc "arr[@name='author']/str")]
                       (map #(.. nodes (get %) getValue) (range (.size nodes)))))))))

This:

  - walks through the document parsing (and loading into memory) one
    full "doc" node at a time

  - uses XPath to pull out all of the str values for "author"

  - Gets the string values for each author node and returns them



2.  Parsing MARCXML records

Slightly more fiddly because of the namespaces, but much the same:

  (with-open [rdr (reader "/some/where/marc.xml")]
    (let [context (nu.xom.XPathContext. "marc" "http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim")
          titles (xml-picker-seq rdr "record"
                                 (fn [element]
                                   (.. element
                                       (query
                                        "//marc:datafield[@tag = '245']/marc:subfield[@code = 'a']"
                                        context)
                                       (get 0)
                                       getValue)))]
      (doseq [title titles]
        (do-something-with title))))
